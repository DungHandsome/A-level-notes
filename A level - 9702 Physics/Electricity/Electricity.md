# Electric current

> [!key] Definition
> - **Charge carriers**: The particles which **carry charge** and are **free to move** (can be electron or ions)
>	- Unit to measure charge: **Coulomb (C)**
>- **Electric Current**: the flow of charged carriers **in a certain direction** (the electrons drift in a certain direction)
>	- Unit to measure current: **Ampere (A)**

- Equation involves **charge** and **current**:

$$
\bf {I = \frac {Q \text{ (Total charge go through a point)} } {T}}
$$

- Derived equation for current:

$$
Q = nVq
Q 
$$

$$
\bf {I = Anvq}
$$

Where
- _L_ = length of conductor
- _A_ = cross-sectional area of conductor
- _n_ = no. free electrons per unit volume
- _q_ = charge on 1 electron
- _v_ = average electron drift velocity
